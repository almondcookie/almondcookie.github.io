# Project: Memory Game
### Installation
> No installation required (life is good)!
### Purpose
To improve your memory, try to find all the matching pairs to win
### Approach
* Initially focused on the logic of the game and displayed numbers
* Broke down the logic: 
    * Has there already been a match and if not, check the following:
        * If there is a match, keep the numbers up
        * If there isn' a match, remove the number
    * Include a reset button to clear the game
    * If the user finds all the matches, then he/she won the game
* Then focused on the aethetics
    * Replaced numbers with images
    * Included a default image to simulate the front of a card
    * When the user clicks on the card (as if the card was turned over), an image appears that needs to be matched
